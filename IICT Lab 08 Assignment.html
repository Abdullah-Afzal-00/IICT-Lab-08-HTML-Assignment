<p style="text-align:center;font-family:sans-serif;font-size:20px" title="Hostory of PUCIT">Located in the heart of Lahore, neighboring the buzzing Anarkali Bazar and the Mall Road,
 PUCIT is the largest institution of higher learning in Pakistan in Computer Science,
 Information Technology, and Software Engineering. The College took a modest start with
 the Center for Computer Science, established in the Center for Solid State Physics,
 Quaid-e-Azam (New) Campus, Lahore, in 1988. The first degree program offered by the 
Center was a one-year Post Graduate Diploma (PGD) in Computer Science.
 24 students were registered in this program during the first year. 
The Center was upgraded to Department of Computer Science in 1991. 
The Department started 2-year (4-semesters) PGD leading to MSc in Computer Science under
 the annual system. In its first batch, the 15 students were admitted to this program. 
The number doubled the following year.<br>
The Vice Chancellor, Lt Gen (R) Arshad Mahmood, further upgraded the Department to a constituent College in November 2000.
The college was named Punjab University College of Information Technology (PUCIT). The College launched the 4-year (8-semester) 
BSc (Honors) in Compute Science program in November 2000. The classes of the new BSc (Hons) in Computer Science started in January 
2001 with about 180 students. The program was offered on Self-Support basis only.<br>
The PGD leading to MSc in Computer Science was converted to MSc in Computer Science in February 2001. 500 students were admitted 
to this program during the first (Spring) semester. However, due to the non-availability of sufficient number of classrooms, half 
of the students were shifted to Fall 2001. About 180 students were admitted in BSc (Hons) Computer Science and 500 in MSc Computer 
Science for the Fall 2001 semester. The College launched 4-year Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BIT), 2-year Master 
in Information Technology (MIT), Master in Electronic Commerce (M. E-Com), and 3-year MPhil leading to PhD in Computer Science in 
Fall 2003. Inter-flooring in the old library building was done in 2003, thereby creating space for the current library. PUCIT 
established its own Internet Service Provider (ISP) and software house, Agile Technologies, for automating key business processes 
in the College and bridging the gap between industry and academia. The GIS Center moved to PUCIT in 2004. The Free and Open Source 
Software Awairness Campaign (FOSSAC) was held at PUCIT in August 2005.<br>
The curricula for all Bachelors degree programs were revised according to the recommendations and guidelines of the HEC, Institute 
of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) USA, and Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) USA in July 2006. MS/MPhil Computer 
Science and MSc GIS (morning) programs were launched in Fall 2006 and BS Software Engineering in Fall 2007. The College took major 
infrastructural renovation projects starting June 2006 to renovate existing faculty offices, construct new offices for around 30 
faculty, install new multimedia equipment and PCs in class rooms and teaching labs, purchase new PCs for the GIS Centre lab, install 
underground campus computer network, and uplift the library interior with tiled floors, wall paneling, individual study desks, and an 
e-mail kiosk in order to make the library environment more conducive for studies.<br>
The first ever research grant proposal was submitted to HEC for Rs 4.1 Million funding in March 2007. The first ever PC-1 since the 
establishment of the College was submitted to the Education Department Government of Punjab in May 2007 for Rs 11.3 Million funding 
for upgrading IT infrastructure in the College. The funding was released in June 2007 and used to purchase 200 new PCs for labs and 
three high-end server class machines. Two more PC-1 documents were submitted for Rs 99.61 Million funding from the HEC to build the 
Software Engineering Block and Rs 74.36 Million funding from the Education Department Government of Punjab to construct a multi-purpose 
building, upgrade lab infrastructure, establish final-year project labs, construct 10 start-up incubators, and establish wireless “hot spots” 
throughout the College. Process for the construction of two 3-sotrey buildings through College and University funds was initiated in June and July 2007.
